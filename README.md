# mumble-bot

A simple mumble bot for playing YouTube audio. There's not much in here at the moment, but this will probably be extended as time goes on.

### Setup

Requires [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to work properly.

You'll also need to create a config file named `config.yaml` with at least a username and address specified based off the following:

```yaml
username: "foo"
address: "example.com:64738"
```
