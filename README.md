# mumble-jukebox

A simple mumble bot for playing audio from YouTube, and [other sites supported by youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html). Simply send the bot a link, and it will download and play the audio. This is pretty limited at the moment, but will be extended over time. Feel free to report bugs and suggest features via the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/joshheinrichs/mumble-player/issues).

### Setup

Requires [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).
